I believe it is especially important to avoid the ravages of litigation when children are involved.
The majority of my mediation clients are actively seeking to divorce. I also mediate all of the following: pre-marital agreements (formerly known as prenuptial agreements), marital agreements i.e., conflicts between spouses who have not decided to divorce (formerly known as postnuptial agreements), post-divorce disputes and cohabitation (and co-tenancy) agreements between unmarried partners.
As collaborative counsel I am committed to the least adversarial practice of law possible. I believe collaborative legal representation offers the best hope for a non-adversarial resolution when mediation is not an option.

My hourly fee for divorce mediation is $350, and clients sign a fee agreement and pay $3,000 as a retainer at the beginning of the process. While all divorces are unique, if a couple owns one house, has two children and are committed to resolving their differences, they can expect their mediated divorce to cost in the neighborhood of $3,500. Most couples share the cost of their mediation.&lt;/p
","Since opening my mediation practice in 1992, I have mediated hundreds of divorces and related interpersonal conflicts with both traditional and non-traditional families.&lt;/p
","Mediating family disputes is at the heart of my practice. Believing that clients are the best experts on the life of their family, I focus on helping them craft fair and lasting settlements. Despite my client-centered approach, I will become actively engaged in the process when the parties approach an impasse. As a lawyer-mediator, I often draft all the court forms needed for a Massachusetts divorce. I encourage clients to do as much work as possible on their own to help minimize their mediation costs.&lt;/p

I've helped individuals litigating their divorce, usually affluent women, prove their marital lifestyle by preparing a lifestyle analysis to provide to the court. I've helped individuals plan for divorce or just figure out what their life could look life so they could make a more informed decision about whether to divorce. I've helped individuals who married with assets they had already accumulated on their own calculate the value of their separate property.&lt;/p
","With the exception of child custody, divorce is a financial settlement and should be approached that way. I provide couples with the understanding of their after tax marital estate as well as income and expenses so that mediations can be done with both short term and long term information on how a proposed settlement will affect both parties. This information during mediation facilitates better understanding and helps avoid misunderstandings and promotes settlement.&lt;/p

Payment can be made by check, money order, credit card (Visa/MC, AMEX), Zelle, PayPal, Venmo or cash. Receipts are provided for all payments.

","Most clients have similar issues they need to address such as the house, the pension, and college education for the children. I therefore follow the tenet that mediation can be approached in fairly structured manner so as to minimize mediation fees, maximize the productivity of sessions by keeping clients focused, and expedite a resolution before the conflict is allowed to escalate. Nevertheless, I also believe that the process should also be flexible to properly address the uniqueness of each couple's situation such as different religious requirements, or the needs of a gifted child. I have a facilitative style with a true belief in self-determination; I also has an eye towards settlement and am glad to provide resources that can help clients move towards resolution.&lt;/p

I am the author of   The Generous Prenup: How to Support Your Marriage and Avoid the Pitfalls   (2018). My articles on prenups and on mediation have also been published in numerous publications, including mediate.com.  I believe that mediation is a talent, and that remaining neutral and unbiased are two of the most important aspects for success in the process.&lt;/p
","I believe in practicing mediation in the   shadow of the law  . This means that I will make sure mediation clients are informed as to what a legal court process or application of the law would suggest as an outcome, or a range of outcomes. This is because I believe the   law   is a distillation of equitable principles. Then people can make knowing and thoughtful choices and informed waivers. Another important quality of an effective mediator is responding truthfully to what is happening in the room. People trust you if they perceive that you're being truthful. That helps in the mediation process. Another area of my practice had been estate planning and probate of estates. I formerly practiced real estate law as part of my practice and started my law practice as a tax lawyer in a large downtown firm. This knowledge base and skill set works well with issues that come up in mediation.&lt;/p

",,"CARE Marriage Mediation Process&lt;/p
What to expect if you would like to work on your marriage and take it to a loving, nurturing place.&lt;/p
Caucus (30 minutes)  I prefer to make separate appointments for husband and wife by phone or zoom to properly understand what issues you are dealing with. Sometimes it is more appropriate for me to proceed right away and meet jointly with husband and wife.&lt;/p
Joint sessions (90-120 minutes)  Five steps to explore issues, develop effective tools, and share critical perspectives to help move your relationship to a loving and happy place.&lt;/p
Step 1- Each of you gets the opportunity to say your story.&lt;/p
Whether you are dealing with communication issues or relationship issues, this process can pave the way for healthy dialogue and a loving relationship. We work together to identify issues and proceed to address them with care and sensitivity. One of my favorite books relating to this stage is Richard Calson's &lt;emYou Can Feel Good Again.&lt;/em&lt;/p
Step 2- I invite each of you to present 3 things that you would like improved by your spouse, and 2 things that you feel you can work on to improve the marriage.&lt;/p
In session we explore why you feel these 5 items are important to your relationship and to your marriage. I advise people to start with one small step of improvement in each area. One of my favorite books relating to this stage is James Clear's &lt;emAtomic Habits.&lt;/em&lt;/p
Step 3- What is Your Love Language?&lt;/p
Sometimes couples seem to be devoted to each other but feel terribly disconnected. In this step we explore what fills your love tank and what depletes it. You and your spouse will have an opportunity to understand your own love communications language, and what communications are valued by your spouse. One of my favorite books relating to this stage is Gary Chapman's &lt;emThe Five Love Languages.&lt;/em&lt;/p
Step 4- Learning the Art of Loving Conversations&lt;/p
When husbands and wives deal with difficult situations they will often slip into doses of contempt and defensiveness. Some simple changes in technique and presentation can help your spouse hear your concerns and enable you both to stay in problem solving mode, and on the same team. When you gain expertise in this area you will find that difficult conversations can actually be endearing (with a touch of humor) as you act as best friends. You both recognize that your love is greater than the issue at hand, and you can resolve issues together. One of my favorite books relating to this stage is John Gottman's &lt;emThe Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work.&lt;/em&lt;/p
Step 5- The Path Forward&lt;/p
Conversations are the key to resolving issues and building a loving home. When you and your spouse develop the mutual ability to talk things through you have the keys to happiness and serenity. In this step we discuss what it takes to feel secure and safe in the relationship so that you can have open conversation with your spouse. You will learn the power of &ldquo;leaning in&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;leaning out&rdquo; when you have a concern in the relationship. One of my favorite books relating to this stage is &lt;emCrucial Conversations &lt;/em(Patterson, Greeny, McMillain, Switzler).&lt;/p
It is important to me that our sessions be as effective as possible. I encourage you to fill out authorizations to any therapists and mentors that you have, to be allowed to speak and collaborate with me. With your permission we can create a team to help you. I look forward to assisting you on your journey to a happy and nurturing marriage.&lt;/p

You have a reason for feeling what you feel, doing what you do, and thinking what you think. After I acknowledge your experience, we start clarifying where you wish to go and exploring options for how to get there.&lt;/p

She charges for her time on an hourly basis. If the parties request, she can prepare legal paperwork for them at the conclusion of their mediation. If she does prepare paperwork, she will ask for a retainer to pay for her time and the necessary court fees. The amount of the retainer varies depending on the complexity of the issues.&lt;/p
","Sharon has been an attorney in Oregon for over 30 years. Her practice has focused exclusively on family law matters since 1989. In the course of that time, she has helped hundreds of clients through the mediation process. Since 2006, she has maintained her full time mediation practice as a solo practitioner and has served hundreds of parties, both represented by attorneys and self-represented. In mediation, Sharon's goal is to help parties resolve all aspects of family law matters including custody, support and property division issues in the context of divorce, paternity, domestic partnership and elder law matters.&lt;/p
","Sharon is acutely aware of the costs, both financial and emotional, that family disputes have on individuals and their families. She believes mediation can be a great benefit to individuals and families on both an emotional and a financial level. She strives to make all parties feel they have a safe and productive experience when they utilize her for mediation. Depending on the situation, parties either meet together in one room or sometimes a   caucusing   or shuttle method is used where Sharon moves between two rooms. Depending on the needs of the individuals and the issues involved, her approach is largely facilitative encouraging the parties to work the details of the resolution with her assistance. However, sometimes parties seek   evaluative   assistance, if they are not familiar with the various legal issues around their problems. She is a licensed attorney in Oregon, but as the mediator she cannot provide the parties with individual legal advice. However, she can provide them with legal education as to the laws and customs in Oregon and she will provide referrals for individual legal advice as parties desire to attorneys and qualified professionals such as CPA's as needed.&lt;/p
","Sharon received her Juris Doctor in 1985 from Willamette University College of Law and graduated from the Scholars Program at Portland State University in 1982 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Political Science. She has taken many courses in mediation including both beginning and advanced coursework.

","Since completing the A. A. White Mediation training at the University of Houston Law School, Patricia has facilitated more than 350 mediations, helping couples reach peaceable divorce settlements. Many of Patricia's mediation cases are referrals from attorneys that recognize her financial/mediation skills to help bring the couple to settlement. Satisfied clients refer friends and other budget minded clients choose Lifetime Planning services after researching available options.&lt;/p
","Patricia's approach to mediation involves separate meetings with each spouse to establish individual goals and interests. A questionnaire is provided to guide them in gathering financial documents and coming up with a budget. A spreadsheet is then created with percentages for each spouse, based on goals and the rules of equitable settlement. We often devise   what-if   scenarios to graphically illustrate a client's position post-divorce. We review each asset valuation and determine the proportion of separate and community property. Tax adjustments are calculated for assets such as capital gains, IRAs, 401ks, pensions, stock options, etc. so that each asset class is weighted on a more equal footing with the other assets. If alimony is possible and appropriate it can be offset with assets to give the paying spouse more of their pension (or other asset) and show the tax savings.&lt;/p
When emotions run high as they often do during a divorce, she encourages clients to consider this as a business transaction and to look toward their future, not the past. Patricia provides professional, personalized advice at all times.&lt;/p

Mediation is really based in psychology, not law. It's about helping individuals and couples find the best path and the healthiest way to move forward by giving them a compassionate, supportive, non-judgmental environment to be heard and explore options. We do not conduct   settlement negotiations.   That's what I call   mediation   during litigation where sessions usually are conducted in separate rooms with lawyers and litigation strategy is brought into the discussions. Instead, we cut through all that and focus on the couple's real goals, needs and hopes. In getting down to the basics and building back up, people are able to see their way to workable solutions.&lt;/p

My practice covers Family Law, Estate Planning, and Administration, with ongoing education in legal and mediation fields since my JD in 1984.",http://Carrollcountylawyers.com,United States,Westminster,Maryland,21157,21157,Adult Family|Divorce (all issues)|Divorce (parenting)|Estate Planning|Family|Marital Mediation|Online Family/Divorce|Prenuptial|Probate,Arbitrator|Estate Planner|Mediating Lawyer|Mediation Trainer|Mediator-Arbitrator|Representational Lawyer,"Each mediation session is two hours in length, and I charge $500.00 for each session, with each party typically sharing the expense and paying $250.00 each. If an agreement is reached, the fee for the preparation of a complete Marital Settlement agreement is generally $1000.00, with that fee also usually split between the parties. For unmarried parties where there are no property issues, a lesser fee may be charged for the parenting agreement, which varies based upon the complexity of the agreement.&lt;/p
As the Agreements I prepare need to be notarized, many parties also return to my office to execute the final Agreement in the presence of one of the notaries at my office. There is no additional charge for this service.&lt;/p
","I have been a practicing mediator of over 20 years and currently conduct approximately 100 mediation sessions per year. I conduct private mediation sessions for people who attend mediation before commencing litigation, as well as mediation sessions for people referred to me by the Court after suit has been filed, but before the case is litigated. I have dealt with all issues related to child custody, child access, and child support for unmarried parents, and these same issues and all other issues that arise out of a marriage for married couples, including all financial issues, such as retirement accounts, pension division, and spousal support.&lt;/p
","I utilize a facilitative approach to mediation, where I assist the parties in coming to their own agreement. I believe that it is the parents who know what best serves the interests of their children and themselves. In addition to formulating a parenting plan, I will assist married couples with the equitable distribution of any marital assets.  
I firmly believe that, in almost all instances, an amicable agreement reached by the parties through mediation, is preferable to a judicial resolution. Parents of children will need to interact with one another for the rest of their lives, and to be able to do so amicably, will make it easier for them and for their children.&lt;/p
","I received my Bachelor's Degree in 1981 from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, double majoring in Economics and Political Science. I then attended The Catholic University of America, Columbus School of Law in Washington, D.C., graduating with my Juris Doctor degree in 1984.&lt;/p

 - Timing: Do the parties have enough information to make decisions? Mediation can facilitate the exchange information and make decisions in discovery disputes like an arbitrator or special master.&lt;/li
 - Communication: Are the participants able to convey their perspectives and understand what the other side is saying? Cases can (and do) settle even though the parties do not agree on what happened, or what the law provides, or what will happen in the future (i.e., in court).&lt;/li
 - Strategy: Do the parties and counsel have a strategy for the mediation? How will they respond to narratives that they find objectionable, litigation threats, and monetary offers or demands that are &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; or &ldquo;pie in the sky?&rdquo; &lt;emResponding&lt;/em to these challenges is very different than &lt;emreacting&lt;/em to them.&lt;/li
&lt;/ul
&lt;p class=When I believe a difficult conversation needs to happen, I will structure it in a clear and safe manner so that it addresses the issues contributing to impasse. This has helped parties resolve highly competitive, &ldquo;money-driven&rdquo; disputes.&lt;/p

As a non-attorney mediator, Brian works in synergy with the parties' attorneys. He is skilled in recognizing when questions or issues require an attorney's involvement, and is careful to refer the parties to their respective attorneys for personalized advice and actions.&lt;/p

","As a mediator, I seek to understand the nature of the parties' dispute, their interests and concerns, whether the parties want or need to preserve their relationship, the nature of barriers to resolution, and the history of any settlement negotiations. This helps me adjust my approach to best assist the parties in resolving their conflict and, if relevant, preserve and even improve their relationship. I help create a comfortable, respectful setting, encourage the parties to share information and views, and assist them to engage in constructive problem-solving. When appropriate, I can be evaluative, offer suggestions for approaches to resolution, or coach the parties in managing conflict. I have extensive experience with multi-party and family business conflict.

Our standard mediation fee for the services of an attorney/mediator is $400 per hour.&lt;/p
For two attorney/mediators in a session, the fee is $700 per hour.&lt;/p
If the services of a Marriage and Family Services are requested, the fee for that professional is $175 per hour. If combined with an attorney/mediator in joint session, the fee is $500 per hour.&lt;/p
","Although it seems like I've been mediating disputes since I was five years old, the inspiration for the Settlement Works mediation program came only after a 25 year career in civil litigation and family law, as well as many additional years of self-realization and transformational work.&lt;/p
In my work with the Center for Enforcement of Family Support, a law practice dedicated to helping custodial parents collect their past due support, I saw the anger many divorced couples still carried, even many years after their divorce was final. I saw that this anger pre-empted and frustrated the resolution of legal issues, resulting in exorbitant legal fees and leading to residual emotional damage, especially to children caught in the middle.&lt;/p
In 1999, I founded Settlement Works and began to explore a new approach to legal conflicts. Using traditional mediation as a cornerstone, this evolving approach offers an efficient resolution of legal disputes while addressing and healing the unresolved emotional issues of divorce and other types of family and civil conflicts.&lt;/p
Using this approach I have mediated hundreds of Family Law and Civil Litigation matters.&lt;/p
","I look at mediation as an opportunity to engage in an informative exchange of ideas and opinions, while helping litigants resolve their differences with an economically and emotionally beneficial outcome.&lt;/p
While successful mediation often entails several styles of dispute resolution, the most important element is safety. My goal is to empower the clients to appropriately express their wants and needs, while they develop and practice listening with a reasonable level of receptivity. I believe clients should be given a basic understanding of the laws at issue, so they can make informed decisions. I usually share my analysis and viewpoint freely with both parties, helping them see the strengths and weaknesses of their case.&lt;/p
Although mediation can be very serious and have a significant impact on a party, I find it helpful to create a relaxed atmosphere with as much lightness as is appropriate and possible. At Settlement Works, we are fortunate to have our mediation on a classic Chris Craft motor yacht (  Concordance  ) in Marina del Rey. Our clients tell us that the relaxing environment greatly reduces the stress of the meeting process. Personally, I find that communication flows more freely &ldquo;on the water.&rdquo; More often than not a client's wistful comment on the beautiful life going on outside, is all it takes to get the parties thinking that it really is time to work things out.&lt;/p
","I am a graduate of UCLA School of Law and hold a B.A. in Psychology from Arizona State University.

","I have substantial training and experience in various mediation styles including, evaluative, facilitative, transformative and narrative. I will work with you and your attorney or representative to tailor the mediation process to the needs of the parties and nature of the dispute. My mediation process can also assess the conflict competency of the parties and can provide coaching when needed. As to arbitration, I will follow the rules of any administered program and in the event of a non-administered arbitration, I will provide appropriate rules depending on the nature and complexity of claims, number of parties and alleged damages. In non-administered arbitrations, I will usually hold a prehearing telephonic conference to review with the parties or their attorneys the many ways we can structure the arbitration process.&lt;/p

In mediation, based on the initial individual consultations with the parties, I estimate the amount of time the process will take and then design a customised package proposal, which caps the client's financial risk (i.e. if it takes longer than I estimated, you aren't trapped in a situation where you incur unbudgeted-for extra costs. When I mediate, my firm requirement is that all parties are required to make a financial contribution towards my fees and costs. It doesn't have to be 50-50  it is based on ability to pay, but there must be some payment, so that my neutrality is evident even in financial terms. If mediation is in a workplace context I enter into an agreement with the employer whereby payment will then be their responsibility, and I then require the parties to dispute to sign an Agreement to Mediate.&lt;/p
For coaching and consulting we also work off a base rate, coupled by ability to pay.&lt;/p
","I first started professionally working as a mediator after I completed my training at the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada, 13years ago, and as a conflict coach after my training with Cinnie Noble, about 12 years ago.&lt;/p
My ADR experience goes back decades, first when I was a trade unionist in Nova Scotia, where we regularly had to rely on mediators to assist labour and management to avoid industrial action and resolve contentious issues in collective bargaining and other workplace disputes, and subsequently in South Africa, during the height of the transition from apartheid to democracy. I therefore witnessed a range of mediators working with very different disputants under diverse circumstances and learned a great deal. In my own experience in mediating both workplace and family disputes, I continue building my understanding of conflict dynamics and ways of breaking impasses and creating unexpected positive solutions.&lt;/p
","Influenced by my background in conflict coaching I prefer to get to know each of the disputants first: their understanding of the conflict as seen through the lens of their own experience, values, needs, mandates, etc., and how they understand the other party's context and priorities. These are highly confidential conversations. They serve to give me information and insights and they also serve to establish trust between us (it is as important for the mediator to trust the client as vice versa). I do not invite the parties into the same conversation until I am satisfied that they are able to shift from their original positions in a way that takes the conversation forward in a construtive manner. When the mediation results in consensus, or agreement on some points and not others, I write up the agreement and give both parties the opportunity to review, clarify and refine it. In a family law situation, where the clients would rely on the agreement in court proceedings, I advise them to have the agreement scrutnitized by their respective lawyers, before signing.&lt;/p
At times when agreement cannot be reached, I would continue working with a disputant, providing conflict coaching, which enables them to work out a way of moving forward despite that no agreement had been reached. a&lt;/p
A standard feature of my mediation service it that I remain accessible to all parties for a period up to three months after the signing of a mediated agreement, in the event that some difficulty arises regarding the interpretation or application of the agreement. At times I would continue to facilitate a parental discussion around the managing/implementation of a parenting plan.&lt;/p

","While I still litigate cases on a regular basis, I believe that the alternatives to dispute resolution are better for everyone involved in the process. From the standpoint of mediation, my initial approach is to develop a process for dialogue and to facilitate a resolution driven by the parties. If the process stalls, I will provide evaluation as needed to help keep the dialogue moving towards resolution. From the standpoint of arbitration, my approach is to establish a hearing process that is expedient and cost-effective and that is a true alternative to litigation, not just a substitute. I provide parties with a neutral, experienced, and fair perspective on issues presented to me for decision.&lt;/p

In addition, we can serve as both a coach and advisor through the process. We can help you evaluate your spouse's information, and initiate and evaluate settlement proposals. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of our client's position, and various proposals while being sensitive to the importance of our role in the process. We assist by attending mediation sessions and participating directly in the mediation, especially with respect to complex financial issues.&lt;/p
","We recommend initial mediation to most of our clients as a means to resolve family law disputes effectively in a cost efficient manner. Mediation allows spouses to face each other in a non-confrontational setting to address their differences and to determine their future course of action without the mandate of a court or the cost of litigation.&lt;/p
Research indicates that mediation is successful in more than one-half of the cases and that parties with mediated outcomes are less likely to have post-agreement disputes. With the enactment of Title 17 of the Maryland Rules relating to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), there are even more opportunities for mediated resolution of the complex financial aspects arising out of a divorce. Mediation allows both parties to become educated about the realities of litigation in an informal process, without the harsh reality of a court order. The rules of evidence do not apply and witnesses are not called. Mediation may take one or several sessions. The goal remains mutually agreeable resolution and the mediator's suggestions may provide substantial guidance. Subject to certain delineated exceptions, mediation is confidential, and &ldquo;a mediator and any person present or otherwise participating in the mediation at the request of the mediator shall maintain the confidentiality of all mediation communications and may not disclose or be compelled to disclose mediation communications in any judicial, administrative, or other proceeding.&ldquo;&lt;/p

","Once an interested person contacts me, I offer a 30 minute free consultation. During this consultation I ask the person to provide a brief explanation of the dispute or problem to be solved and then I explain the mediation process. The free consultation gives the interested party an opportunity to ask questions and, importantly, get a sense if they could be comfortable working me and trust me. If the person is interested, I ask to be put in contact with the other person or people that will be participating in the mediation so that each can also meet with me for a free consultation.&lt;/p
Once the parties decide to engage me, I send two documents: an &lt;emAgreement to Mediate&lt;/em and a&lt;emFee Agreement.&lt;/emEach of these documents need to be signed by each person participating in the mediation. The next step is for me to conduct in-depth interviews of each participant. During these sessions I explore the nature of the conflict or problem and probe about what each participant wants to achieve. It is during these interviews the location and timing of the mediation is determined. I am prepared to mediate via phone, video, or in-person.

Whenever possible, we encourage parties to share payment of our fees so that everyone is invested when sessions begin.&lt;/p
For ongoing facilitation/mediation services for senior care professionals, we can charge either a per-session fee or work from a monthly-averaged fee.&lt;/p

","AIM Aging Issues Mediation focuses on adult family and eldercare facilitation/mediation.&lt;/p
","At AIM Aging Issues Mediation, we begin through an intake process in which we talk with potential parties to the mediation in advance of any mediation sessions. The intake conversations are designed to help parties understand the mediation process and to help us identify both issues of concern and the persons needed to participate in order to resolve existing questions and disagreements.&lt;/p
We next encourage all parties to meet together for an initial group session to improve communication, lessen tensions and identify primary issues for discussion. When it is helpful, we provide education on aging issues and we refer families to appropriate senior care professionals for expert assistance. We then follow up to facilitate communication among the parties as they explore resources and potential solutions.&lt;/p
We again encourage all parties to meet together for discussion when it seems they have enough information to form a plan to meet the needs of the individual(s) at the heart of the controversy. We help the parties define and state their plan in writing and ask each to sign off on the plan as a pledge of their support going forward.&lt;/p
Throughout the process, we help those involved express themselves to other family members and, in turn, listen to others. We encourage parties to express their feelings, but require that they treat everyone with respect throughout the mediation process. We continue to remind everyone involved that the decisions they make must be the best choices possible for the older adult involved and should honor his/her wishes to the extent possible.&lt;/p

Carol Betts,cdbetts@seattlefamilylawyer.com,,Colaborative Attorney and Mediator,Carol D. Betts Family Law &amp,"""Mediation PLLC"" is a professional limited liability company specializing in conflict resolution services through mediation, helping parties negotiate and settle disputes outside of court.","As an attorney and a mediator, I help divorcing couples resolve property, support and parenting issues by agreement. Traditional litigation processes tend to feed and escalate conflict. I feel people are better served by maintaining control over results and managing conflict in a way that engages rather than divides. Since 2007, I've focused my practice on client centered alternatives to litigation including mediation and Collaborative Process. A successful outcome begins with identifying your interests, needs and goals. Skilled communication moves the process forward. Agreements are reached when interests are prioritized and addressed.
  
I am an attorney who has practiced family law in Washington State since 2001. In 2007, I trained in Mediation and Collaborative Law process and began focusing entirely on helping families resolve issues without court intervention. Since then, I've completed hundreds of additional training hours in communication, interest based dispute resolution, and co-parenting coaching. In April 2019, I completed the required number of observed mediation hours for Mediator Certification from the VOAWW Dispute Resolution Center in Snohomish County. In addition, I have a special interest in recovery from substance use disorders and the impact of these diseases on the family system.

I accept a limited number of cases on a sliding scale when both parties earn less than 400% of the Federal Poverty Guideline.&lt;/p
","After training in mediation and Collaborative Law practice in 2007, I began representing clients as a Collaborative Process attorney. In Collaborative Process, participants enter into a Participation Agreement confirming their intention to work toward a negotiated resolution together with a professional team. They agree not to resort to courts for decision making. The process is interest based and involves many of the same skills used by mediators. I refreshed my mediation training in 2010 and added mediation services to my family practice. Although the skills in Collaborative Practice and Mediation are similar, there is a key difference  mediators are neutral and do not give advice whereas Collaborative Process attorneys represent and advise one party. I've been practicing as a solo mediator but wanted Certification which requires observation by other trained mediators. In September 2017, I began the Practicum program at the VOAWW Dispute Resolution Center in Snohomish County in order to complete the observed mediation hours required to earn Mediator Certification. I received Certification in April 2019 and continue to volunteer at the DRC in addition to my private practice.&lt;/p
","I primarily practice interest based mediation (generally referred to as Facilitative Mediation). This means that I work with parties to identify their goals, needs, and interests as well as the needs and interests of children if the participants are parents. Then I facilitate a conversation where participants consider ideas and resolutions that value and incorporate their needs and interests. Parties in this style of mediation have a strong interest in maintaining control over the resolution and avoiding court intervention.&lt;/p
The interest based approach differs in significant ways from the evaluative settlement process often used by litigation attorneys. In that mediation process, the parties are generally in separate rooms with their attorneys and the mediator   shuttles   offers back and forth. It is a more give and take negotiation with the specter of a looming trial strongly influencing the result. This process can be helpful in some cases but generally feels more adversarial.&lt;/p

Upon request, he is happy to provide an estimate of his total fees prior to commencement of his mediator or arbitrator services.&lt;/p
Mr. Cole will travel anywhere in the continental United States as arbitrator and mediator at no cost for either travel time or direct travel expenses to parties for arbitration hearings or mediation conferences that last three (3) days or more. For arbitration hearings or mediation conferences lasting one (1) or two (2) days, direct reimbursable travel expenses and reasonable travel time are billed to the parties as agreed upon between Mr. Cole and the parties at the commencement of his services.&lt;/p
","GARY L. COLE, AIA, ESQ. has served as both a Certified Mediator and an arbitrator in over seventy-five (75+) construction, commercial and real estate-related disputes, ranging from $10,000 to over $15,000,000 in claims involving a wide variety of complex dual-party and multi-party claims and counterclaims under American Institute of Architects (AIA) and other industry-standard and custom construction agreements and real estate documents.&lt;/p
He has arbitrated and mediated many complex condominium and single-family homeowner disputes between owners, developers, contractors, subcontractors and home owner associations. He frequently mediates and arbitrates pro se cases, where one or more parties represents themselves without an attorney.&lt;/p
DISPUTED ISSUES have included contract performance failure and breach, claims involving design and construction defects, material and structural failure, change order disputes, uncompleted punch list issues, HVAC non-performance, scheduling and delay claims, non-payment and mechanics lien claims, cost overruns, unforeseen site conditions including foundation and caisson issues, fraud allegations, code compliance, partnership development agreement issues, alleged intellectual property and related copyright infringement issues, foreclosure, loan modification and asset relinquishment, and a wide range of other construction and commercial claims and disputes.&lt;/p
","Mr. Cole tailors each mediation's approach to the needs of the dispute and desires of the parties. He draws from his backgrounds as an experienced construction and real estate attorney, and as a licensed architect to provide an   Evaluative/Facilitative   mediation approach, which includes examining the parties' pre-mediation conference document submissions to understand each parties' allegations, arguments and documentary evidence.&lt;/p
Prior to a mediation conference, he discusses separately and confidentially with each party their positions and goals along with what he considers to be each parties' positions' strengths and weaknesses based on his review of the parties' document submissions. These informed evaluations allows parties to evaluate and consider whether a mediated settlement is in their best interest, or, whether binding dispute resolution such as arbitration or litigation offer better possible outcomes.&lt;/p
During the mediation conferences, he guides the parties through discussions of the more legally and technically problematic aspects of their disputes. These discussions, along with his pre-mediation conference confidential evaluations of each parties' positions' strengths and weaknesses, allow the parties to continuously evaluate and re-evaluate their positions and their settlement options as the mediation conference progresses.&lt;/p
Mr. Cole is happy to discuss his mediation approach with the parties, and to tailor it to their desires and expectations for achieving the best opportunity for resolution and settlement.&lt;/p

Some say disputes are manifestations of deep-rooted conflict. I would say that when unattended, arguments and disputes can easily concretise into conflict  almost like a normal wound if allowed to fester turn gangrenous. So, the question comes &ldquo;Is dispute a manifestation of inherent conflict OR hardened disputes lead to conflict!?&rdquo; I would say that both are possible depending on the circumstances.  
When parties are in a conflict situation they are in a competitive negative mindset and they always see the glass half empty. So, it is always better to seek advice from a third Neutral party who is not involved in the conflict itself.&lt;/p

Here are the key steps to potentially work with Robin Sax/Dear Co-Parent:&lt;/p
&lt;ol
 - Initiate Contact:

 - Reach out to Robin's intake system by emailing &lt;a href=mailto:casemanager@robinsax.com target=_newcasemanager@robinsax.com&lt;/a (copying Robin at &lt;a href=mailto:robin@robinsax.com target=_newrobin@robinsax.com&lt;/a) or call the office at 424-402-1729.&lt;/li
 - Provide Information in order for us to complete a conflict check (you can reply to this email with this information too):

 - C. Contact information, including email, phone, and physical address.&lt;/li
 - D. Name/contact information of any lawyers involved.&lt;/li
&lt;/ul
&lt;/li
&lt;/ul
&lt;/li
 - Joint Services (Co-Parenting, Mediation, PPC):

 - If seeking joint services, forward this email or your initial email to the co-parent/spouse/partner, copying the office so everyone sees the same communication at the same time.&lt;/li
 - A conflict check will be performed to ensure there are no conflicts of interest.&lt;/li
&lt;/ul
&lt;/li
 - Conflict Check (needed for all clients, individual and joint conflicts):

 - The office will perform a conflict check, requesting the first and last names and contact information (email, physical address, and phone numbers) of all parties.&lt;/li
 - This step ensures there are no conflicts that could compromise the working relationship with Robin.&lt;/li
&lt;/ul
&lt;/li
 - Intake Form:

 - Once conflicts are cleared, prospective clients will receive an individual intake form.&lt;/li
 - This form should be filled out as completely as possible to expedite scheduling.&lt;/li
 - This comprehensive form is the first step to scheduling a consultation with Robin.&lt;/li
&lt;/ul
&lt;/li
 - Free Informational Zoom with Robin Sax:

 - After conflicts are cleared, clients have the opportunity for a 20-minute informational Zoom call with Robin Sax.&lt;/li
 - During this call, Robin will explain her practice philosophy, work style, and background.&lt;/li
 - She will review office policies, procedures, and fees and answer any questions clients may have.&lt;/li
 - If attorneys want to attend this meeting, they may but both attorneys shall be invited if there are two attorneys involved.&lt;/li
&lt;/ul
&lt;/li
&lt;/ol
This meticulous process ensures that clients and Robin Sax can establish a clear understanding, free from conflicts of interest, and allows for a comprehensive intake before moving forward with consultations and services.&lt;/p

In my mediation practice, I employ a thoughtful and directive approach, combining legal acumen with therapeutic skills to guide parties through the resolution process. I believe in fostering an environment where individuals feel heard and acknowledged, recognizing the significance of allowing each party to express their perspectives openly.&lt;/p
By creating a space for genuine dialogue, I aim to unveil the areas of true importance to each participant. This process not only facilitates a deeper understanding of individual needs and concerns but also assists in pinpointing common ground. I have found that, more often than not, parties are not as far apart in their views as they initially perceive.&lt;/p
A key facet of my mediation style is the encouragement of a non-defensive atmosphere. I understand the natural inclination to be guarded during conflict, and I work to dismantle those defenses, allowing for more productive and constructive conversations. By alleviating defensiveness, individuals can better engage with one another, leading to a more effective mediation process.&lt;/p
Moreover, I am mindful of both financial and emotional resources throughout the mediation journey. I recognize the importance of efficient use of time and financial investments, striving for a resolution that is not only legally sound but also considers the broader emotional and psychological impact on the parties involved.&lt;/p
In my practice, I focus on uncovering common goals shared by the parties. By emphasizing these shared objectives, I aim to redirect attention away from adversarial positions toward collaborative solutions. This collaborative approach not only fosters a more amicable resolution but also ensures that the mediation process serves as a platform for building consensus and finding mutually beneficial outcomes.&lt;/p

During the mediation, I actively listen to all perspectives, carefully evaluate party dynamics, and establish rapport, creating a conducive environment for resolving disputes.

Possessing a deep understanding of complex legal and financial issues, I am able to offer valuable assistance to parties in assessing risk and identifying motivations for settlement.

My mediation approach focuses on establishing trust among all parties, ensuring that each participant feels heard and that the process is fair.

Joy's background includes cost/value analysis and negotiation in multinational and regional settings.",https://jhadrservices.com,United States,Fort Garland,Colorado,81133,81133,Accidents|Adult Family|Autism|Bullying|Business|Cannabis|Civil (general)|Commercial|Community|Construction|Contracts|Divorce (all issues)|Divorce (parenting)|Education|Elder|Employment|Environmental|Evictions|Family|General|Government|Health Care|HOA|Landlord - Tenant|Marital Mediation|Natural Resources|Neighbor to Neighbor|Non Profits|Online Civil|Online Family/Divorce|Online Mediation|Online Workplace|Organizational|Parent-Teen|Partnership|Personal Injury|Pet Mediation|Prenuptial|Probate|School/Education|Small Claims|Special Education|Workplace,Collaborative Professional|Conflict Coach|Facilitator|Mediation Consultant|Strategic Planning,"Standard Mediation Pricing:  
Hourly rate of $175 with a two (2) hour minimum. The minimum fee of $350 is due prior to the first session.&lt;/p
Divorce Mediation:  
A fixed fee rate is provided based upon the issues and considerations of the specific situation where the quoted amount is based upon a maximum number of sessions and a maximum number of hours of work to be performed outside of the sessions.&lt;/p
Example: A standard divorce mediation, that includes the following services, would cost $1,925   
 Two (2) 30-minute online individual introductory sessions  
 Three (3) joint online mediation sessions (max 1 hour each)  
 Seven (7) hours of work (includes all document review, document and session preparation, phone calls and email communication, as well as final document creation, etc.)&lt;/p
A deposit of 25% is due prior to the first session. Thereafter, incremental invoicing is provided at the 50% completion, 75% completion and 100% completion, just prior to receiving the fully executed Settlement Agreement/Memorandum of Understanding.&lt;/p
","Joy has been a certified mediator since 2009 in the State of California and renewed this certification in 2019. Over the last decade, Joy has volunteered most of her time with various Dispute Resolution Centers (DRC) around Southern California and other non-profits to provide mediation services at either a reduced fee or for free. Joy has mediated divorce cases, community disputes, small business disputes, family conflicts, and housing issues.  
With a desire to be able to help as many people as she could, Joy decided to start her own online mediation and ADR business, JH ADR Services, in 2020.&lt;/p
","The one thing that Joy loves most about mediation is the control and power that it gives to the parties in determining their own outcomes. You know what is best for you. You shouldn't have to be told by attorneys and judges what you have to live with. Mediation gives the people who are impacted the most with the decisions made, control in making those decisions.&lt;/p
Joy's approach to dispute resolution is flexible based upon the needs of the parties and the type of dispute being resolved. Understanding the needs of the parties in resolving the dispute helps to identify if her role as mediator should be more facilitative or evaluative. She strives to assist the parties to be at their best so that they can effectively determine their best outcome. She encourages collaboration, focused communication and creative problem-solving so that the parties can find solutions that work for them.&lt;/p
","Degrees include:  
Master's degree in Dispute Resolution  
Bachelor's degree in Communication  
Associate's degree in Business&lt;/p
Trainings and certifications include divorce and family mediation, online mediation, elder and probate mediation, ethics, diversity, and bias awareness, among others.&lt;/p

I am a volunteer mediator for Small Claims Court and Community Mediation Services.&lt;/p
I'm also trained in restorative justice and believe that mediation can be a healing environment.&lt;/p
","My approach is that mediation is not just a faster cheaper way to resolve conflict than litigation(although it is). I have seen that mediation provides an opportunity for you to share your story, understand your own perspective better and get a better understanding of the person you're in conflict with's point of view as well.&lt;/p
Parties are happier with resolutions when they come to them themselves. You are an expert in your own life, so it makes sense that you're in the best position to come to a resolution that leaves you feeling satisfied and stronger. It may feel like at the beginning of mediation you need guidance or that the person you're in conflict with needs to be told what to do, but I've seen time and time again people start in intractable disputes and come to resolutions they feel good about.&lt;/p
My approach is mediation looks like you want it to look. I'd love to talk to you more about what that means and how it applies to your conflicts.&lt;/p
I also find there are times that co-mediation with two mediators is very beneficial for parties. I partner with another mediator from a different faith background for interfaith mediations including decision making around weddings and children as well as interfaith divorces.&lt;/p

","&lt;span data-contrast=autoLet's face it, divorce is a stigmatized word. It evokes a range of emotions from fear to anger and hurt. Divorce is generally not a positive experience, but one that must happen if a spouse or both spouses wish to end their legal relationship. We can help take some of the sting and uncertainty out of the process by helping divorcing partners and parents by guiding them through this and letting them process their feelings and thoughts in a collaborative way with a goal in mind. That goal is to streamline the divorce process in a way that causes no harm or added conflict, manages expectations, and identifies shared end goals for everyone. Along the way, our firm can offer additional professionals to support you through this as needed. When opting to mediate a divorce, parties have consciously chosen to participate in a collaborative process that will with the assistance of the mediator and up with a full settlement of all the issues that in divorce.&lt;/span&lt;span data-ccp-props={quot;201341983quot;:0,quot;335559739quot;:160,quot;335559740quot;:259}&lt;/span&lt;/p
&lt;span data-contrast=autoWho is it for? Many folks will benefit from mediation. The no-court, confidential options suited for many people. But, by far, helping parents through a difficult time and making children's lives more peaceful is what I value most on a personal level. I see the harm that is sometimes caused by overly aggressive and high conflict cases, and I always jump at an opportunity to dial down any conduct that could damage a child.&lt;/span&lt;span data-ccp-props={quot;201341983quot;:0,quot;335559739quot;:160,quot;335559740quot;:259}&lt;/span&lt;/p
&lt;span data-contrast=autoThe indelible mark of divorce is something that a child will carry permanently- and they have no role in deciding that their family unit will be changing. So, to honor the children by thoughtfully pursuing a peaceful divorce is something I will always encourage. Divorcing parents can often find support with the assistance of an experienced mediator.&lt;/span&lt;span data-ccp-props={quot;201341983quot;:0,quot;335559739quot;:160,quot;335559740quot;:259}&lt;/span&lt;/p
&lt;span data-contrast=autoErin is a trained litigator with many years of advocating for her clients in the courtroom. She has parlayed the knowledge and skills acquired and transferred them to helping couples fairly and equitably have the discussions necessary to divide and transition to a post-divorce family. She reminds couples of their continued role and obligations as parents to their children and works together with her clients to ensure that the children's best interest is held as the highest priority in resolving many difficult parenting issues. During mediation we will discuss and attempt to resolve complex parenting schedules, how day to day decisions is made, how time with the children will be shared and when to introduce a new partner. Divorced families present challenges as many families have gone through trauma and difficulties before ever reaching our office. But, with the appropriate resources and sound advice, we can help you transition peacefully and process this divorce in a way to cause your family the least harm.&lt;/span&lt;span data-ccp-props={quot;201341983quot;:0,quot;335559739quot;:160,quot;335559740quot;:259}&lt;/span&lt;/p
&lt;span data-contrast=autoErin is a certified mediator and has successfully mediated hundreds of cases since 2004. Erin will schedule an informative initial consultation with a couple via Zoom in order to meet and provide information in order to assess if mediation is a good fit. If everyone agrees, then meetings on Zoom or in person can start immediately and the work can get started. Usually, a mediation lasts between 3-6 sessions, although some can take longer if the issues are more complex. Fees are much less than litigation and will save you tens of thousands in legal fees.&lt;/span&lt;span data-ccp-props={quot;201341983quot;:0,quot;335559739quot;:160,quot;335559740quot;:259}&lt;/span&lt;/p

Kohl,reports+kohl@milemarkmedia.com,,Columbus Foreclosure Defense &amp, Consumer Law Attorneys,"Unfortunately, the provided context ""Kohl &amp"" is incomplete and does not contain enough information to create a summary. Please provide a complete sentence or paragraph for a summary to be generated.", Cook Law Firm LLC,"Sean M. Kohl is an accomplished Ohio and Pennsylvania attorney with a diverse background representing small businesses and consumers against the abuses of the banking and mortgage servicing industry. Too often big law firms and large national banks do not treat local small businesses and consumers fairly. Sean strives to even the playing field in his practice by providing individualized and practical representation to each of his clients based on their unique needs and circumstances.
Sean is an Eagle Scout and grew up in a blue-collar Ohio factory town where he learned the value of hard work, honesty and respect &ndash; values not often shown to small businesses and consumers. Sean received his undergraduate degree from Bowling Green State University and his law degree from Western Michigan Cooley Law School graduating&lt;emcum laude&lt;/em. Sean worked part-time as a high school teacher and securities regulator for the State of Michigan to put himself through law school where he received national recognition for his litigation skills &ndash; specifically in moot and appellate court competitions.
After law school Sean worked in the oil and gas industry for Oklahoma City based Chesapeake Energy. At Chesapeake, Sean collaborated with Ohio and Pennsylvania landowners to cure and clear oil and gas title to help explore and develop the Utica and Marcellus shale plays. Sean transitioned to corporate law and litigation by accepting a position at Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease, LLP. Sean acquired a great deal of complex business litigation and regulatory experience during his time as a lawyer at Chesapeake and Vorys. However, Sean's true passion is helping people. Big national banks and mortgage companies often hold many unfair advantages over their customers, and Sean fought hard to combat those abuses at Doucet amp; Associates Co., L.P.A.
Sean wanted to offer personalized and vigorous representation to small businesses and Ohio consumers so he and his business partner, Timothy Cook, established Kohl amp; Cook, Law Firm LLC. Sean's current practice focuses primarily on mortgage foreclosure defense, consumer protection, and civil litigation combating the abuses of debt collectors and mortgage servicers. Sean also advises small startup businesses as general counsel.

","My approach to mediation is to determine the goals of each participant and to rank those goals in order of priority. I try to determine what is most important to each participant, and what items are less important. To reach compromise I try to find an approach or suggestion wherein each side can budge on items of lesser importance to them and greater importance to their opponent. In doing so, in many cases, both sides can get what they really want most, while giving up things that are of lesser importance.&lt;/p

","My approach is non-directive and I follow the belief of the ICF that generally people are creative, resourceful and whole and that given space and time to work out what is happening that they will be able to figure out the best way forward for themselves. Therefore I work one on one with parties before they come together. I am a keen advocate of reflective practice and am a member of three learning and sharing groups where we avail of #8216;group supervision'. I use a hybrid of approaches but generally find the conflicts that I am asked to intervene is have a large relational component. I work with clients who may have become disconnected from themselves as well as from others on connecting back in with themselves in a real way. From this space it is easier to approach conflict situations.&lt;/p

My expertise spans marital dissolution, asset division, custody, and support issues, as well as prenups, adoptions, and LGBTQ+ matters. I'm certified in arbitration and dispute resolution.",http://www.foresterfamilylaw.com,United States,El Dorado Hills,California,95762,95762,Divorce (all issues)|Divorce (parenting)|Family|Marital Mediation|Online Family/Divorce|Online Mediation|Pet Mediation|Prenuptial,Arbitrator|Mediating Lawyer|Mediation Consultant|Mediator-Arbitrator|Online Arbitrator|Parenting Coordinator,"I work both as a neutral and as a representative in &lt;emnon-litigation-based&lt;/em family law matters. My hourly mediator fee is $450, though I also can offer flat fee mediation depending on the complexity of the individual case. My arbitrator rate is $500 per hour, as is my rate in a representative capacity in a mediation or arbitration.&lt;/p
","I have been working in the ADR arena for many years in private settlement conferences, and in stand-alone mediations and arbitrations. I have worked with hundreds of family law clients in varied roles (representative, consultant, mediator, arbitrator), and have focused my practice since 2020 on ADR exclusively. I have conducted dozens of virtual mediations and arbitrations since then, though I have also worked in   in-person   matters during this time. In 2021, I began the process of obtaining some additional credentialing through the Straus Institute for Dispute Resolution at Pepperdine University's Caruso School of Law, and earned a Certificate in Dispute Resolution in 2023. I expect to earn my LL.M. degree in 2024.&lt;/p
","In mediation, I typically utilize a blended approach, as each case brings with it its own dynamic and special circumstances. In cases that might benefit from a more   evaluative   approach  like those that need a risk assessment if mediation fails and litigation becomes necessary  I lean on my 18+ years as a family law litigator to provide some perspective and a range of possible outcomes that can help parties formulate a more informed settlement. In cases involving more complex emotional or psychological issues, I use a more   facilitative   approach to broaden the settlement discussions and offer creative approaches to resolving particularly difficult issues. The evaluative approach tends to rely more on a   legal   approach to issues, whereas the facilitative model relies more on pragmatism and in finding areas of overlapping interests. Family law matters often involve issues that may require both approaches at different times during the process, and I am comfortable moving in and out of these approaches as the matter requires.&lt;/p
In my role as arbitrator, I find that a less formalistic approach suits most cases, though if the parties and attorneys express an interest in following a particular set of arbitration rules, I will of course accommodate them. Arbitration is much more of a formal legal process than mediation is, though I will invite the parties and attorneys to work together to resolve issues short of the actual arbitration proceeding if that is possible. If it is not, I favor an efficient process that allows for the arbitration to conclude expeditiously, and will generally issue the award soon after conclusion of the proceeding.&lt;/p

My views on divorce mediation are simple. I believe that the goal for divorcing couples is to achieve peace, calmness, and a sense that they have some control over their lives. Mediation is a lot like a swan that glides on a pond. The swan is content, calm. It glides peacefully, not necessarily happy, but not sad either. The swan is at peace, and I hope every couple who comes to me achieves this.&lt;/p
At Lesa Koski Mediation based in Woodbury, MN, I offer a number of different services for clients going through the process of divorce. These include:&lt;/p

","I am a state-qualified neutral who became interested in mediation during law school more than 15 years ago. I grew up in the Stillwater and Woodbury area and now live in Hudson, WI. I care about the people around me and want to see everyone leading the life they hoped they would. I believe wholeheartedly in family and divorce mediation and am dedicated to making a difficult divorce or family situation as painless as possible.&lt;/p
I have been mediating all my life, no matter what my job title declared. I feel that communication is very important and that most problems come from a breakdown in communication. When people can communicate and compromise, problems can be resolved.&lt;/p
Even when I was young, I was always looking for creative and constructive ways to help my friends and family work through their issues. Friends would consult me when they wanted advice. Family members sought out my opinion because they claimed I listened and would thoroughly contemplate their situations. So it seems only natural for me to be in this role. And more than anything, I love helping people. I want to help you get the relief and empowerment you deserve.&lt;/p

","Our primary interest is helping people resolve their dissolution disputes through settlement. This method allows the marital partners themselves to decide their future by making agreements concerning their children, support and assets  rather than to have to live by the decisions made by another person. If parties have taken an active part in determining vitally important aspects of their future and the futures of their children, they can experience an easier time adapting to the major changes a divorce brings to a family, allowing them to move forward in a positive direction.&lt;/p
Mediation can successfully resolve your dissolution of marriage if you and your marital partner: are respectful of one another; are honest with all assets, debts, income, expenses and any facts which have relevance to your children; are motivated to end the financial entanglements; and are responsive and cooperative with requests for material, information, and documents requested by the mediator and by one another.&lt;/p
Please Note . . .  
If you or your partner are excessively angry toward one another; have a desire to hurt the other partner; cannot speak to one another; have been the victim of domestic violence; or you cannot trust your marital partner to be open and honest with the nature and extent of the assets, debts, and income, then mediation is probably NOT a viable alternative for your case.&lt;/p

Anne Howard,anne@abhmediation.com,Straus Institute at Pepperdine University,attorney/mediator,ANNE B. HOWARD FAMILY LAW &amp,Mediation is a conflict resolution process where a neutral third party helps disputing parties find a mutually acceptable solution.,"
Anne B. Howard, Esq. has been licensed by the State of California since 2000 and has been voluntarily settling cases for the San Diego Family Court for over 15 years in her role as a Mandatory Settlement Judge.
She is passionate about keeping people out of the court system by resolving their cases without judicial intervention or helping people get out of the middle of the court system.
Anne believes mediation is particularly helpful when there are children in the family so children do not get   stuck in the middle   of their parents' disagreements.
Anne has been working in the area of family law for over 30 years, as an attorney, a paralegal and a drug court administrator. Anne's varied background includes handling juvenile, guardianship and conservatorship cases as well as family law cases. Her experience in handling a wide range of family-related cases gives her a different perspective to most other mediators.
Anne's many years of experience enable her to help parties achieve creative solutions tailored to their family's needs.Anne litigates but much prefers to mediate. Her litigation experience means she has a good idea of what parties could get in Court. Anne strongly believes that parties should have an idea of what they could get in court to enable them to make educated decisions when reaching an agreement.
Anne provides flat rate mediation services so that parties have an idea of how much the process will cost. Please check out her website at ABHMediation.com.

I believe in helping clients bring the best of themselves to the mediation table and empowering clients to be active participants in making decisions about their lives &ndash; leading to better, longer lasting settlement agreements. A marriage and family therapist is uniquely trained to help people regulate their emotions during difficult processes and allows for an openness that vastly improves the negotiation process. Settlements are achieved in a cooler, calmer emotional environment.&lt;/p
Mediation is a process that brings people in conflict together with a neutral third person who assists them in reaching a voluntary agreement. I help you prepare for mediation, clarify the issues, consider options, and reach a workable settlement that fits their needs. Mediation gives people a relatively quick, inexpensive way to work out their differences while addressing everyone's needs and interests. Decisions reached in mediation are created by the parties involved, not by the mediator or a judge.&lt;/p
I encourage direct communication between the parties and help people decide for themselves the best settlement. It allows for the expression of emotions, often defuses anger, explores creative means of solving problems, and promotes cooperation between people. My style is especially beneficial in situations where there will be an ongoing relationship because the process helps preserve the strengths of a relationship. It often helps people accept the consequences of their own decisions, be open to change, and develops a model for resolution of future conflicts.&lt;/p

Moreover, as these positive dynamics feed into each other, the interaction can regenerate and assume a constructive, connecting, and humanizing character. The model assumes that the transformation of the interaction itself is what matters most to parties in conflict &ndash; even more than settlementon favorable terms. Therefore, the theory defines the mediator's goal as helping the parties to identify opportunities for empowerment and recognition shifts as they arise in the parties' conversation, to choose whether and how to act upon these opportunities, and thus to change their interaction from destructive to constructive (Bush amp; Pope, 2002).&lt;/p
A transformative mediator should be able to:&lt;/p
&lt;ol
 - Be comfortable with conflict, including strong emotion and negative communication patterns.&lt;/li
 - Respect the choices of the parties, including their choice to participate in the mediation. This should be done even if the mediator does not personally agree with the choice the parties are making.&lt;/li
 - Be comfortable with a limited understanding of the parties' conflict.&lt;/li
 - Respect the parties, even if their actions, appearance, language, and attitudes seem completely different from those of the mediator.&lt;/li
 - Be patient with the parties and the process of their interaction.&lt;/li
 - Focus on the moment by moment events in the parties' interaction.&lt;/li
 - Attend to empowerment and recognition opportunities.&lt;/li
 - Choose interventions (and non-interventions) based upon opportunities for party empowerment and/or recognition.&lt;/li
 - Relinquish problem solving and control of the process.&lt;/li

The Insight Approach is the foundation of all my work. Described as the   fourth pillar   of conflict resolution, Insight Mediation seeks to understand and work with the human behaviours that get in the way of productive dialogue. The Insight Approach defines conflict from a social/relational theory as a pattern of behaviours that block learning and openness. Insight Mediators use targeted curiosity to explore the threats that are causing the conflict behaviours, so that destructive patterns of behaviour can be understood and changed. We see these behaviours as a natural human response to a perception of threat.  Rather than containing or correcting the behaviours, we help clients gain insight and clarify meaning. All of this is more productive and efficient as we are getting to the heart of the matter  and the conflict behaviours that block dialogue, so clients can make better decisions.&lt;/p
Facilitative. Client-centred. Consensual Dispute Resolution.&lt;/p

It's important to understand the difference if you want to bring a lawsuit against another driver and obtain full compensation.The word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; implies no one is at fault, while &ldquo;crash&rdquo; suggests someone else is responsible, and is therefore &ldquo;liable&rdquo; for paying for the damages that you experienced as a result of the collision.Crashes involving tractor-trailer trucks are especially dangerous because of their enormous size and weight. Getting hit by one of these commercial semis can result in serious and sometimes permanent injuries.In a collision with a truck or other commercial vehicle? Enlist the help of an attorney who has experience dealing with multi-million-dollar trucking companies and insurance carriers. Our knowledgeable truck accident attorneys can help.
